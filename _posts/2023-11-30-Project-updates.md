Over this year I did my best to dedicate some time to sharpening my skills
and possibly throwing some things on my resume. After understanding that I have been experiencing burnout I decided to reevaluate these projects and get back to working on projects that I like. You can find work anywhere but if you dont like the work you do youll be miserable. With that being said I have decided to axe a few of these projects and write a list of projects that I enjoy. This list will be a better use of my time and reenergize me desire for learning.

Here is a list of the updated projects I was able to complete this year.

### New Project List
This new list will be the projects and places where I will be honing my understanding and skills on different technologies. My goal with these projects is to keep learning fun, work on projects that I find interesting, and come up with fun ways to deploy them using devops best practices and strategies.
