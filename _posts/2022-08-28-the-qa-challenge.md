###### WE ONLY GET ONE LIFE, WASTING SOMONE'S TIME IS THE SUBTLEST FORM OF MURDER 

## If you reading this its never too late
Here is a guide and a list of steps I have taken to help get you a remote job as a QA Analyst position. My expectation is that you read this entire document, follow the steps at the bottom of the page, message me if you need help, and get you pointed in the right direction. BE WARNED: This will be sprinkled with quotes to help you start. I wrote this out because you expressed interest to me in getting a remote job, breaking into the tech industry, or just looking for a career move. I want you to know I am here to help however I can. I want you to not feel like its too late or your too old to get help starting something new.

It's never too late - never too late to start over, never too late to be happy. It's never too late. Don't focus on what was taken away. Find something to replace it, and acknowledge the blessing you have.

### QA ANALYST TERMS AND AGREEMENTS 
Your reading this because you expressed interest in breaking into the tech field and becoming an QA analyst/engineer. I am here to help.. with some caveats. 
As the quote at the top of this page explains, time is of the essence and I find my time to be more important than ever now that I have a child to take care of :). 
With that being said, it is your responsibility to dedicate the time and effort to land a job in the IT industry. The QA analyst position is a great entry level position that can be used to find a remote job and ease yourself into the life of an IT professional. The time it takes for someone to get into the industry all relates to a few factors. 
* How much time you spend learning new things 
* How quickly it takes for you to understands things 
* How long it takes you to ask questions (having me as someone in the industry that can answer the simple and complex questions is like having Lebron James's trainers and nutritionists which can be a tool that should be abused at all times)

I have ready success stories of people who dedicated a month and landed a 50k salary job, and stories of people who spent 9 months or 2 years to get to that level. It all comes down to how disciplined you are to study. External factors like family, moving, illness, and other things may slow you down but you should make sure that they don't stop or halt your progress indefinitely. If you ever fall back in your studies try and use this quote to help you along the way.

If you are ready to get started and looking for steps to become a QA analyst, continue check out my posts on my guide to getting into the Tech Industry and become a QA analysis.  

DISCLAIMER: Currently I am a DevSecOps Engineer and have 5+ experience as a Linux/DevOps Engineer and 10 years of experience in the IT industry. I am not, nor have I ever been label a QA analyst. I have worked with a large handful of QA testers/engineers/analysts and have talked to some that I am close with on creating a guide for breaking into the industry. These steps have no direct guarantee of getting you a job in the field or landing a job at a specific company. This guide cannot guarantee a 6 figure salary. It can however, help you understand strong concepts of today's modern approach to software architecture, my understanding of it all over the years, and common concepts and questions during technical interview or parties where tech is being discussed. 

I am writing this guide to follow a quote that I try to live by and pray that I can show success stories in the future of people who followed these steps and changed their careers.
