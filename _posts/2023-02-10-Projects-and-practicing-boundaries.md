#### Exhaustion 
If this year of parenting and navigating through depression has taught me anything its that my time, more specifically my free time, needs 
to be purposeful. I have spent a lot of time investing in a few other people and going through the run around of "Helping me get into the IT feild" 
or "I need helping moving/ I need help building this app or website". Time and time I have found myself extending too much of my energy in 
projects that dont benefit myself or my family and leave me in an inconvenient bind. Talking this out with my wife has helped me realize that 
I haven't been investing in myself. This blog page is supposed to be used as a time capsule for me to look back on and remember the challenges I have 
faced in my IT career or the projects I created over the years. I have a list of projects I started back in 2018 that can showcase my strenghts and skills 
in my IT journey but never have time to draft them out or showcase them. As a way to 
create boundaries and adhere to keeping my skills sharp, focusing my free time on myself and my family, and having something to look back on, I have created a list of projects I plan on completing this year. 

Some of these projects are things I have already started, but never finished. Most of these are pojects I have been talking about for years but never set the time to complete them. Im hoping to finish one project a month to have a total of 12 for the year (with a possibliity of finishing all projects on this list). We are already in February and so far I have been failing, but that changes today. 

##### Intention 
My intent for these projects is to have clear descriptions of what they are, what they do, how to use these projects for your own use, and a great README.md file with all 
that information in each of these. This list will be a growing list and will be updated with links to each project once they are either completed, or at a point that is presentable. Writing this blog in itself is helping me fight imposter syndrome and 
create small steps to "creating boundaries" and focusing on myself. 

If you find any of these future projects useful or helpful in any way feel free 
to let me know via twitter @techdadteddy or [buy me some coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tmeralus). Anything is appreciated.
