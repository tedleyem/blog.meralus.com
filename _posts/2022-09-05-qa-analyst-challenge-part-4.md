# Preparing for Interviews 

 
###### *WE ONLY GET ONE LIFE, WASTING SOMONE'S TIME IS THE SUBTLEST FORM OF MURDER*

If you made it this far its time to start preparing for interview and working through any unfinished coursework to add the certificates of completion to your resume. All companies are looking for different things when positions are posted online so unfortunately my interview advise is quite vague. 

##### Do more than just read the company's 'About Us' page
This may be a company you work with for a long time. Its important to check their reviews on [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/), Consider looking at how many job openings the company has, are the opening up a new office and need to fill it or are they going belly up and need to try and pack as many employees as possible to show numbers to investors and sell quickly?!? These questions are only half scary, don't worry. Your goal here is to make sure the vague mission statement on their website aligns with your goals, thoughts, and beliefs. The last thing you need is to end up being a [Dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA063IaOHyQ)

##### Prepare for scenario-based questions
Most IT related jobs will ask scenario based questions. Typically these are open ended questions to determine ways in which you think or how you would resolve an issue. You can find these online as they typically change depending on the job/role/responsibility. A few questions I have found online that can help are below. 

* How do you handle conflict b/w your team members?
* How do you handle your resource who is at onsite and not willing to share much information?
* How would you compose you team for testing an ecommerce application?
* How do you handle client escalations?
* How do you ensure there will be no billing loss in your project?

##### Practice answering competency-based questions online. 
*a quick google search can help find some of those*
##### Brace yourself for technical interview questions. 
*the questions answered in the courses above should help with basic competency*
##### Remember, soft skills are key.
*Be honest, be kind, be respectful. Many interviewers will ask vague questions or question they want you to find a solution for. These questions are not meant to attack you, take your time and be honest with your answers. They can smell fear and will appreciate your honesty.*
