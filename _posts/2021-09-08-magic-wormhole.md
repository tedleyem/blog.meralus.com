3 years ago I was looking to test a new app called magic wormhole.
I needed to find a way to send 8gb of data and copying it from one usb 2.0 seemed to slow. I didn't want to upload all of that to my google drive or OneDrive accounts and then re-downloaded them. As a linux user I wanted to find a solution as simple as rsync to copy files, maybe get a progress bar to find out when its going to be done, and something simple to use. The internet introduced me to magic-wormhole.

Magic Wormhole does one thing: Get things from one computer to another, safely. I was able to move the 8gb of files from one computer to another in my home and fell in love with the tool. At the time there were connectivity issues and a sluggishness and slowness to it, so  I stopped using it. Today I had found a sharing site that provided old dreamcast games that revolutionized my childhood and gaming. I need to get in a few rounds of Project Justice, play and beat Chu Chu Rocket, and finally beat Chicken Run!. All the files I have now are saved on a macbook now which I need to move to my laptop and eventually to a blank dvd :). I figured since I have used it once, lets find out what the magic-wormhole developer(s) have been up to, and to my surprise, I get perfection. A professionl grade github repo, which, to developers who have been using Github, is a major turn on.

With a list of 50 contributors and 80+ companies using it I was so excited to see this little project grow up. I ran a quick brew install and apt install from my macbook to my lenovo thinkpad and boom I was on my way. With the simplicity and style of rsync  I was able to copy these games with ease, watch a cool progress bar, and remind myself that Terminal is king!  

Check out the Magic-Wormhole application and try using it to copy files SIMPLY and SECURELY!
