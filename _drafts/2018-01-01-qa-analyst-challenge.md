###### WE ONLY GET ONE LIFE, WASTING SOMONE'S TIME IS THE SUBTLEST FORM OF MURDER 

## If you reading this its never too late
Here is a guide and a list of steps I have taken to help get you a remote job as a QA Analyst position. My expectation is that you read this entire document, follow the steps at the bottom of the page, message me if you need help, and get you pointed in the right direction. BE WARNED: This will be sprinkled with quotes to help you start. I wrote this out because you expressed interest in getting a remote job, breaking into the tech industry, or just looking for a career move. I want you to know I am here to help however I can. I want you to not feel like its too late or your too old to get help starting something new.

It's never too late - never too late to start over, never too late to be happy. It's never too late. Don't focus on what was taken away. Find something to replace it, and acknowledge the blessing you have.

### QA ANALYST TERMS AND AGREEMENTS 
Your reading this because you expressed interest in breaking into the tech field and becoming an QA analyst/engineer. I am here to help.. with some caveats. 
As the quote at the top of this page explains, time is of the essence and I find my time to be more important than ever now that I have a child to take care of :). 
With that being said, it is your responsibility to dedicate the time and effort to land a job in the IT industry. The QA analyst position is a great entry level position that can be used to find a remote job and ease yourself into the life of an IT professional. The time it takes for someone to get into the industry all relates to a few factors. 
* How much time you spend learning new things 
* How quickly it takes for you to understands things 
* How long it takes you to ask questions (having me as someone in the industry that can answer the simple and complex questions is like having Lebron James's trainers and nutritionists which can be a tool that should be abused at all times)

I have ready success stories of people who dedicated a month and landed a 50k salary job, and stories of people who spent 9 months or 2 years to get to that level. It all comes down to how disciplined you are to study. External factors like family, moving, illness, and other things may slow you down but you should make sure that they don't stop or halt your progress indefinitely. If you ever fall back in your studies try and use this quote to help you along the way.

# What is QA Testing? 
Here is a guide for tips and tricks on becoming a QA Analyst.
QA stands for Quality Assessment or Quality Assurance. 

The textbook definition of QA Analyst is as follow: 
A QA analysts, in a broad sense, test products across industries to ensure a brand's quality standards are met and regulatory compliance standards are upheld. However, in a modern world, QA analysts typically work in a high-demand, technology-driven role testing software that meets individual and enterprise needs for all industries. For people looking to start a job in a growing technical field, becoming a QA analyst may be a good fit. In this article, we discuss what a QA analyst does, their work environment, what salary to expect, skills required and how to become one.


In Ted's Terms, 
A QA analyst is a quality tester that is used for checks and balances. If An engineer is building a car, a QA tester would drive the car or check the air pressure in the tires of the car, or the height and weight, or more, before the car gets sent to a dealership. In the software world there are lists of applications that can run and pass tests that will click buttons to make sure they are doing what they need to be doing or checking the speed of websites when links or clicked, but humans are the end users of most software tools and humans are still needed in the process. That is were QA comes into play. Because testers of software don't necessarily need to understand a programming language or know the architecture of a system, this make it an easy entry level way of breaking into the IT field. 
With that being said, QA analysts end up learning to read programming languages and understand system architecture and design while running tests which also makes it a great place to grow in the field as well. 


# QA Automation Tools 
A good question when learning about QA testing is What tools or software should I use or learn with? What are some common terms to know for interviews? What should I download to get started? Here are some popular tools and verbiage to look into for conversations and understanding. 

**SOFTWARE**
* Cypress end2end automation tool [https://www.cypress.io/]
Currently used at my job for testing API and Frontend related components of our application. 
* Selenium 
Website: http://www.seleniumhq.org/
License: Open-source

* Katalon Studio
Website: https://www.katalon.com/
License: Free & Commercial

**Words and References**
* unit test - breaking down small units of code to make sure it works 
* smoke testing - pulling the application into an iso env to run it and make sure its not smoking 
* regression testing - instead of ensuring the functionality of the system we want to ensure the functionality 
of a system with a new feature added. 
*  End To End testing - e2e - testing all components of the application from front to back to ensure stability  

# Things to DO 
Here is a list of first steps that I will need you to complete within 7 days to prove to me that my efforts and time along with your desire to change careers will not be a waste of time for either of us.


## Step 1: Build a Resume 
use google docs (free) if you have a gmail account or use microsoft word online for free (if you have a hotmail or msn or microsoft account it comes free with your account).  

## Step 2: Share the Resume 
-[] Share the resume to me so I can help review it and give you the next steps on keeping it up to date. 

## Step 3: Social Media 
-[] Create a linkedin profile 
-- add all your work experiences, regardless of if its not in the tech field, some people during the interview process like to see where your career first started and like asking what got you into the Tech field. 

-[] [add me on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmeralus/)
--because i have been using linkedin my impressions and search appearances show up at a lot of recruiters screens. Adding me will allow you to pop up in other recruiters search engines when they are looking for candidates. 

## Step 4: Github 
-[] Create a Github profile 
-- github is an online place where developer and programmers share code. It has become so popular that companies keep their projects on there. The linkedin and Github accounts are the first steps to building an online presence to showcase your skills and makes it easier for people to look you up. These profiles can be made with ease and will boost your appearance when people search for you on google. Linkedin can also be a tool for applying for jobs, talking to recruiters, or looking up businesses. 


TIP: add a picture to your github profile. Adding a picture helps certain people see that you use your profile frequently enough to give it some character. This may or may not help with landing a job but it has been mentioned in meetings that I have been in when it comes to hiring someone. My profile picture in github and the one I use at work gets compliments and helps me stand out of the crowd.


## Step 4: Send me the data 
Now that we have the beginnings of your online portfolio and you have proven your interest in starting in this direction we can start the real studies. 




#### Certificates and Criteria
My goal here is to help you get a certificate to help solidify and showcase your skills as as software tester. Getting a certificate will help employers prove that you have the knowledge, discipline, and the skills it takes to test their software. 
My selfish goal is to be able to have closer friends in the IT field that I can share information with or talk tech around a campfire with burgers and beverages in the near future. I am selfishly trying to help you so that I can build this community. 

#### Criteria 
My dad helped me get my Comptia A+ certificate when I showed him how hard I studied and gave me an option that I plan on giving you. He proposed that he would help pay for half of the certificate exam for me so I don't have to stress about paying for the exams. If I passed the exam, he will pay for half of the second part of the two part exam again. If I were to fail either of these exams I would have to pay him the full amount of the exam. Knowing that the exam was half paid off helped easy my mind and let me focus more on the studies. I am willing to do the same for you. 

Your option, if you choose to take it, is what I like to call the double or nothing option. 

Option 1: Ted will pay for half of any certification exam for certificates related to getting a job in the tech field. If you choose this option and fail the exam, you must pay Ted back the full amount for the exam. 

Option 1 example: Exam costs $200. Ted will assist in paying $100 (or 50%) or the price of the exam. If you fail the exam you will have to pay Ted back $200 (or the full price of the exam)


Option 2: Ted will pay for the entire cost of the exam. If you fail the exam you will have to pay Ted back double the amount paid for the exam. 

Option 2 example: Exam cost $200. Ted will assist in paying $200 (or 100%) or the price of the exam. If you fail the exam you will have to pay Ted back double (or twice the full price of the exam) equalling $400 



## Step 5: Begin the real studies  
Now that you are finally here and have read through this entire thing we will start your studies and I will send you new study material for popular websites to get your certified and on track. You must text me "I am ready to take on the QA challenge and waiting for the next steps". 
Once you have texted that send an email with the following criteria
```
Subject: QA Analyst Studies (first name)
Body: Hey, i'm ready to get started in my journey to become a QA analyst, help me with step one. 
my github username is <your github profile user name or github url >
```

# Side Notes 
I take pride in finding cheap and affordable laptops and have highly considered buying macbooks for $200 so if you feel that you might need a computer that is up to speed for testing and want me to buy you one Im willing to work with you to find the right machine for testing. I have been forced to use macbooks for work because these jobs won't buy me a machine with linux installed on it for stupid security reasons. I thinking finding slighly older macbooks or laptops no one uses anymore are great resources to get everything you need to build your career. I started with a $200 laptop and tried to make a promise to myself that I wont spend $60,000 to build a career. Currently if I had to total all the money I have spent to get the certificates I have gotten and the laptops I have used for studying purposes only I have spent less than $1,000 to gain the knowledge you can get from a 4 year university degree. 
If that is something that interesting you, you can put it in an email.
