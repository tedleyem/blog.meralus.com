# Control vs Comfort
I worked with some school district friend my mom had to find out how to get a job in the district.
Maybe the job title will allow me to rebrand myself in a more professional light and let people who I build websites or applications for take me seriously. My expectations, controlling multiple computers from a control tower every day and monitoring system activity to make sure kids weren't going on bad sites. Unfortunately, my reality became walking kids to the principals office and breaking up fights in the lunchroom. The Instructional Tech Support Assistant 

 
# Networking and Not working
networking and extending offers out to meet people
business men vs men in business (hedge fund junkies)

# The palm beach Tech Space
Trying new things can be scary and intimidating. What makes it worth while are the memories and meaningful relationships
that come from new experiences. I pride myself on my ability to adapt abruptly to situations around me.
Joining Palm Beach Tech Space's first Hackathon is definitely one of the events in my life that will go in my book if I ever write on$
