My theory on the future of Movies has a lot to do with the culture of the media, the future of Meta's Metaverse, and the pages of Ready Player One. Sit back and enjoys as I explain my theory of "relaTVty" 
Sometime during 2016 I was going through what I called "The Year of Ted" which was inspired by the hilarious Seinfeld episode from season 8, episode 22, The Summer of George.  I was looking for self help books and looking to read more because I hadn't picked up a book intentionally since high school (unless it was comic or graphic novel). I had found Cal Newports Deep Work, which was a brand new book at the time that helped me learn to organize myself more and focus on where I was going with my life and my career. I was so engulfed in self help books at the time I started to pick up audio books to help get through them better. My first initial thoughts about audio books felt like the first time I tried cotton candy. I didnt have to force myself into my room or stop myself from getting day to day things done. I had spent over a decade listening to podcasts so the transitions seemed effortless. I asked myself back then "If audio books and podcasts get me this excited, I wonder what the next best thing will do". 

I spoke with my brother about it and came up with a theory. 

Here comes 2021 and Mark Zuckerburg introducing (Meta)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjNI9K1D_xo]. After my (21 day daniel fast)[https://www.21dayprayer.com/daniel-fast] in which I fasted from social media (instead of food) I quickly found out that I was spending a lot of my time and attention using social media apps. I embedded the common phrase "Comparison is the theif of joy" that year into my brain and dedicated myself to finding enjoyment in reading books or finding new ways to focus my attention on the world and the things around me. 

A book called Ready Player One dropped into lap that year. I had asked someone at a local book store about a new sci-fi book that has something to do with tech or video games and they said 'I have just the book for you'. I read the book faster than drinking a bottle of water after playing 4 pickup games of basketball. I couldn't put it down! At the top of the new year there were rumors and discussion that the book was being picked up and adapted into a movie. My excitement for the film was like a rollercoaster of emotions. My friends and family didn't seem to care at the time. I think the idea that I was telling them to read a book felt foreign to them because, like myself  before my year of Ted, none of them were avid bookworms nor found pleasure in reading unless they needed to for work, cooking, or everyday life. Once I found out that Steven Spielberg was going to take the reigns and help with the movie I pulled $20 out of the bank and left it in my wallet just to be ready for when the movie comes out so I can rush to the theatre when it comes out. In hindsight, I knew it wouldn't come out for another year so having money in my pocket wouldn't have made much sense. 

I started thinking about how they might butcher the film or what the difference might be before they even mentioned they finished writing the script or casting people for the film. Just when I thought I couldn't get any more excited I started think about how great the film would be if you could watch it with VR goggles like you would have done in the oasis from the book. 

Image a world like The Oasis. Throw on a VR headset and get to go to school or go to work and never having to leave my house would be the coolest way to live in a new world engulfed by technology... I thought. At the time I would have been ready to give up my soul in Sword Art Online fashion to be in a VR world that I can control. Now, in 2022, after watching (The Social Dilemma)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma] and limiting my social media usage to 15-20 minutes per app, I have a newfound look at my theory.
