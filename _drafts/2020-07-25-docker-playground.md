# Things I learned in 2018 about Docker and Ansible

By definition: (Docker)[https://www.docker.com/] is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

Also by definition: (Ansible)[https://www.ansible.com/] is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

Now that the boring is out of the way.
