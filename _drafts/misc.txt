To solve your problem:

    Install sysfsutils
    sudo apt install sysfsutils

    Edit /etc/sysfs.conf(as admin), add this line at the end of the file:
    /module/bluetooth/parameters/disable_ertm=1

    Save changes and restart

I just tested and this works for me, the controller stays connected. I have not installed an emulators yet tho. Will update this post if anything else comes up. Good luck!
